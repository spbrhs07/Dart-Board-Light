## Bill of Materials

Here you can find all the files you need for creating the light.
The entire project should be doable with about 2kg of filament. I used Sunlu ABS, I'm sure PETG would work fine too. Not sure how well it would work with PLA.
You will need to print the following parts:  
  
-   Frame Left Final x3  
-   Frame Right Final x3  
-   Frame Left Bottom x1  
-   Frame Right Bottom x1  
-   Joint x4  
-   Wide Joint x3  
-   Wide Joint With Hole x1

These parts will allow the light to be mounted flush to the wall. Since this does not provide enough light to the board, there are 75mm wall spacers that can be printed to bring it out for better lighting.  
  
For the wall spacers, you will need to print the following parts:  
  -   Wall Spacer x8      
- Wall Spacer Peg x8  
      
You will also need to print 4 centering pegs.  
The following list of hardware will also be required:
